We're going to use what we've learned and dive deep about searching with Mongoose, to chase down and capture an elusive and world-renowned thief, Carmen Sandiego. Follow the clues, and figure out where Carmen's headed, so we can catch her and bring her in.

### Setup/Instructions:

#### Starter Code:

- You've been given a `models` folder that holds all the schemas and the seeds. All you have to do is clone this repo then

```
npm install
```
- Go to your `index.js` file and uncomment the insertion commands.

- Run `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`

- Remember to comment out your insertion commands once you've inserted your seeds once, to avoid duplicate seeds.

- You've been given a `server.js` file that has clues for finding Carmen. Read the clues and record your mongoose queries in this file to help you find Carmen and then, tell us where she's heading!!
